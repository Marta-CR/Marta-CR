## Hi there üëã
Thanks for stopping by :)

Dr. Marta Casti√±eira Reis is a Research Technician in Computational Simulation at the Galician Supercomputing Center (CESGA), where she joined in June 2025 to contribute to the ‚ÄúDATAlife‚Äù One Health initiative. Her work leverages high-performance computing to tackle multidisciplinary challenges at the interface of chemistry, biology and data science.

She earned her PhD in Theoretical Chemistry and Molecular Modeling from the University of Vigo in 2019, graduating cum laude under the FPU fellowship of the Spanish Ministry of Science. Prior to that, she completed an M.Sc. in Advanced Chemistry (9.75/10) in 2014 and a B.Sc. in Chemistry (9.45/10) in 2013 at UVIGO, laying a strong foundation in both theoretical and experimental methods.

Marta has authored 28 peer-reviewed publications with over 400 citations (h-index 13), including corresponding-author papers in Science Advances, European Journal of Organic Chemistry and Journal of Catalysis. Her research spans mechanistic studies of organometallic and organic transformations‚Äîsuch as molybdenum-mediated oxygen-atom transfers and copper- and manganese-catalysed reactions‚Äîas well as pioneering automated explorations of interstellar chemistry pathways for aromatic and nucleobase formation.

A committed advocate of open science, Marta ensures that 57% of her publications are open-access and deposits all new computational data on Zenodo. She has secured and co-led multiple grants‚Äîincluding PRACE and NWO HPC projects‚Äîand served as PI on regional fellowships.

Marta is also fond of teaching: in 2024 she enrolled in an M.S. for high school teaching and has completed about 70% of the program; she will soon update the status on this matter :)

In addition to her research roles, she mentors bachelor, master and PhD students in molecular modeling and has co-supervised over a dozen projects across Europe. Beyond the lab, Marta is active in STEM outreach‚Äîspeaking at conferences, science festivals and ‚ÄúWomen and Girls in Science‚Äù events‚Äîand contributes as a peer reviewer for journals such as Nature Synthesis, ACS Catalysis and Catalysts.

You can find her work and data under ORCID 0000-0003-4204-3474 or reach her at castineirareismarta@gmail.com.
